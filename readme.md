Coffeescript Express
====================

This is a port of the default express project template, with all javascript 
files converted to coffeescript, for those who prefer to use coffeescript as 
their primary language.

This express 'starter kit' also provides asset management via 
[connect-assets](https://github.com/TrevorBurnham/connect-assets), which 
allows coffeescript-to-js conversion of client-side code, as well as support 
for less/stylus stylesheet generation.

Requirements
------------

You need to have the following in order to run this setup:
 * Node.js (0.8.4)
 * Express (3.0rc1)
 * Coffeescript (1.3.1)

Usage
-----

after cloning the repository, run the following:

    npm install
    coffee app.coffee

this will start up your express coffeescript app, and you're ready to go.
